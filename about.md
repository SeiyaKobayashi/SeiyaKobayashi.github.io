> "Imagination is more important than knowledge. For knowledge is limited, whereas imagination embraces the entire world, stimulating progress, giving birth to evolution."

## üëãüèº About Myself

I'm a **full-stack software engineer** based in Tokyo, Japan. After graduating from **Boston University** in 2020, I came back to Japan because of COVID-19, and I've been freelancing since then. My latest interest lies at the intersection of **blockchain** and **applied cryptography**, so my job is to envision our future in the context of decentralized internet, and turn such daydreams into reality through software engineering. When I find something interesting along the way, I often end up writing blog posts contextualizing those topics, either in English, Japanese, formal languages or math. Please feel free to reach out to me via [Email](mailto:eng@seiya.work), [Telegram](https://t.me/seiya_kobayashi) or [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/seiya.kb).
